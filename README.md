# YouTube-Shorts-Blocker
A simple Chrome extension that blocks YouTube Shorts from appearing in your YouTube feed. Easily toggle the feature on or off through a user-friendly popup. Perfect for those who prefer a more traditional YouTube experience without the distraction of Shorts.

# Features
Block YouTube Shorts from appearing in your feed.
Toggle the blocking on or off using the extension’s button.
Customize settings with a simple popup interface.

# How to Install
# Download the Extension Files
  Download or clone the repository to your computer.
# Load the Extension in Chrome
  Open Google Chrome and type chrome://extensions/ in the address bar.
  Turn on Developer mode (top-right).
  Click Load unpacked and select the folder where the extension files are saved.
# Enable the Extension
  After loading, you’ll see the YouTube Shorts Blocker icon in your browser toolbar.
  Click the icon to open the popup and toggle the blocking feature on/off.

# How to Use
  Click the extension icon in the top-right of Chrome.
  A small window (popup) will appear with a toggle button.
  Turn the toggle on to block Shorts from your YouTube feed.
  Turn the toggle off to unblock them and return to normal YouTube experience.
  The change will happen immediately, and you’ll see the difference when browsing YouTube.

# How It Works
  The extension uses a simple feature called MutationObserver. It keeps an eye on changes on the YouTube page, and when new content comes up (like Shorts), it blocks it from  showing.
  Toggle On: Shorts will be removed from your feed.
  Toggle Off: You’ll see Shorts as usual.

# Troubleshooting
  Shorts Still Showing: Try reloading the page or restarting Chrome if it doesn’t block Shorts after toggling.

# Tech Used
  JavaScript: For creating the extension and blocking functionality.
  HTML/CSS: For the popup interface and styling.
  Chrome Extensions API: For managing the extension's storage and active tab behavior.
